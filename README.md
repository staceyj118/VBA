VBA of Wall Street 

## Goal 

VBA scripting within Excel was created in Alphabetical Testing as this is a smaller file and easier to amend if necessary. Once completed, VBA scrip was exported and input into Multiple Year Stock Data.  

Key points needed: 
* Ticker symbol
* Yearly Change fromopening price at beginning of year to closing price to end of same year 
* Percent Change from opening price at beginning of year to closing price at end of same year 
* Total stock volume of the stock
* Formatting to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red 

## Process

VBA scripting within Excel was created in Alphabetical Testing as this is a smaller file and easier to amend if necessary. Once completed, VBA script was exported and input into Multiple Year Stock Data. The script performs all key components needed and automatically moves to the next worksheet without having to rerun the script. Once it is finished, a pop-up box stating "Finished" will appear to alert that all actions have been completed.
